## ðŸ§  Models Used

The following machine learning models were trained using **TF-IDF vectorization**:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**

Model evaluation included:
- Accuracy
- Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Confusion Matrix

## ðŸ“Š Features

- **EDA Section**: Visualizations including class distribution, word clouds, and top frequent words.
- **Model Section**:
  - Accuracy comparison between Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
  - Confusion matrices
  - Input field for custom news text to get predictions from both models
- **Conclusion Section**: Highlights key findings from the analysis
